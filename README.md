# Filem

(**FileM**anager)

Filem is a file manager focused on a simple, convenient, and fast experience.

This repository contains all the source code.

The minimum version to install the app is Android 11; this is to avoid complications with handling
permission requests from earlier versions.

All dependencies and their versions can be viewed in the files
[build.gradle.kts(:app)](app/build.gradle.kts), 
[build.gradle.kts(Module)](build.gradle.kts) &
[libs.versions.toml](gradle/libs.versions.toml)
